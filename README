Small Javascript web page which converts Pinyin to phonetic alphabet.

This served mostly as an exercise in "ternary search trees" (TST). From an
existence table of around 400 Pinyin syllables a TST is constructed. Any input
is then matched against the TST.

The endnodes in the TST hold strings with the corresponding phonetic
representation.
